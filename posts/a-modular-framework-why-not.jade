  I couldn't help but notice that we have so many frameworks to create simple and complex web apps. I had never heard of a framework, even after building my first web app. The first framework I was introduced to was Flask. A lot has change since then and today I use [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/).

  Today there are so many frameworks and different ways to build web apps. To name off a few we have Backbone, Angular & Ember. Each of these are great frameworks, but sometimes they're too complex for us. So we have the micro-frameworks that create simplicity in our apps. My concern is that we have so many frameworks attempting to fulfill *all* our needs, that they become too complex. Thus we created micro-frameworks to solve our complexity and re-introduce simplicity, but have you ever realized how many frameworks there are?

  With all the present & future frameworks we attempt to improve the web. Solving various issues from performance, to structure and even the languages we use to build them. This brings forth my question for you: How can we improve what we have without introducing new concepts that differ from framework to framework. I donâ€™t want to learn a framework specific syntax, methods or sub-language just to use a massive library of features and/or the basic components. Why not have a modular framework that we can add and subtract from, with parts we need or want to use. Then we can use our favorite templating language or syntax extended methods. It seems if we had this we could all focus on the same problems.

  A modular framework, written in JavaScript(or CoffeeScript), that is simple or complex. With the ability to remove core components for your own, or expand the core to your needs. A hackable framework for everyone and anyone, that we the community push forward.

  Why not?
